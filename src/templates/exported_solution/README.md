# Code Jam Solution

## Requirements
* JDK 6 or later
* Leiningen 2

## To run:
    1. Make sure your input file name ends with ".in".
    2. Move your input file into the inputs directory.
    3. Type "lein Solve" while in the base directory.
In the input directory, you should now see the solution to your input files in a text file ending with ".out".

## To build:
    1. Edit any of the .cljx files in the src directory.
    2. Type "lein cljx once" to build the clojure files (or "lein cljx auto" to continuously build).
    3. Type "lein solve" to run the solution against the input files in the input directory.
